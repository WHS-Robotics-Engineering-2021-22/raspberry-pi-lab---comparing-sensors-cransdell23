### Physical Process
The physical process that is allowing the raspberry pi to sense the enviorenment is the humidity sensor senses the moisture in the air and sends a value between 1-100 and the code in the raspberry pi converts that into the text we see in the SSH
### Enviornmental Factors
Some things that could affect these are maybe if the room is really bright/dark/dry/or humid
### Coding
Coding takes the values of the sensors and transmits them into units that we can understand
